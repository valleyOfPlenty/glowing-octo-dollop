New Song


When the days are cold and the cards all fold and the saints we see are all made of gold, 
when your dreams all fail and the ones we hail are the worst of all and the blood run stale,
dont wanna hide the truth , i wanna shelter you, but with the beast inside , its nowhere we can hide,
no matter what we breathe we still are made of greed , this is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come
