New Song


When the days are cold and the cards all fold and the saints we see are all made of gold, 
when your dreams all fail and the ones we hail are the worst of all and the blood run stale,
dont wanna hide the truth , i wanna shelter you, but with the beast inside , its nowhere we can hide,
no matter what we breathe we still are made of greed , this is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come


Its a truth that in love and war , world's collide and hearts get broken ,
i wanna live like i know i am dying , take up my cross, don't be afraid
is it true what they that the words are weapons and if it is then everyone best stop stepping,
cause i got 10s in my pocket and i bentcha locket, i am tired of all of these rockers saying come with me.
