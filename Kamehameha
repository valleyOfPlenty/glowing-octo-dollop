I wont be silenced .. you cant keep me tremble when you try it ... all i know that i wont go speechless.
Let the song breate dont try to suffocate me, do not underestimate me , all i know is i wont go speechless.
try to knock me in this cage , i wont just lie down and die , i will take these broken wings and burn across the sky 
hear the echoes saying that i wont be silenced 

We are the warriors that build this town ... from dust, from pain... farewell have gone to take my throne above ... work while they all play



when the days are cold and the cards all fold and the saints we see are made of gold, when your dreams all fail and the ones we hail are the,
worst of all and the blood run stale, dont wanna hide the truth u wann ashelter you but with the beast inside i dont know where to hide, no matter what we breathe we still are made of greed.
