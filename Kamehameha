I wont be silenced .. you cant keep me tremble when you try it ... all i know that i wont go speechless.
Let the song breate dont try to suffocate me, do not underestimate me , all i know is i wont go speechless.
try to knock me in this cage , i wont just lie down and die , i will take these broken wings and burn across the sky 
hear the echoes saying that i wont be silenced
